Introduction
============

This library started as a workaround to bridge missing features in CircuitPython on a
Raspberry Pi's CPython interpreter. After adding so much, the idea for this library
seemed necessary.

.. warning:: There is no garauntee that these modules will work for all CircuitPython
    libraries' API. USE THIS LIBRARY AT YOUR OWN RISK! It is highly recommended to not
    rely on this library.
